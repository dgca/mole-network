# Mole Network

Mole Network is a interchain, cross-chain, and cross-network communication system. It lets you capture, manipulate, and store event data in whatever way you want.

Use the Mole Network to write off-chain data directly to your contract, to transform on-chain data in a cheap and efficient way, or to build a communication layer between your cross-chain application.

## Getting started with MoleNet CLI

1. Clone repo && `cd` into root
2. `yarn`
3. Optional: `yarn add -g nx` (if you don't do this, you'll have to run commands as `npx nx` instead of `nx`)
4. To start the MoleNet CLI and processing ETL Specs: `nx start mole-cli --args="--spec=SPEC-NAME-HERE"`

To learn more about Nx, visit the [Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev).
