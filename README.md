# Mole Network

Mole Network is a interchain, cross-chain, and cross-network communication system. It lets you capture, manipulate, and store event data in whatever way you want.

Use the Mole Network to write off-chain data directly to your contract, to transform on-chain data in a cheap and efficient way, or to build a communication layer between your cross-chain application.
